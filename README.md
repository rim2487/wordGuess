# wordGuess
A simple guessing game where the user has to choose the correct word from a list. User has a limited number of guesses. If the user runs pur of guesses the program will end. 
If you do not guess correctly the program will give you a hint about the word.

I have used some user defined functions



Note: I want to develop this into a program where it takes a random word from a file instead of a pre detremined list.
